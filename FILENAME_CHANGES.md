# Filename Changes Summary

## ✅ Completed Renaming

All filenames have been standardized to follow professional naming conventions (lowercase with underscores, descriptive names, no spaces).

### Data Files
- ✅ `FraudCaseStudy.xlsx` → `fraud_detection_dataset_part1.xlsx`
- ✅ `p2_dataset.xlsx` → `fraud_detection_dataset_part2.xlsx`
- ✅ Cleaned data outputs updated to:
  - `fraud_detection_cleaned.xlsx`
  - `fraud_detection_processed_part2.csv`

### Presentation
- ✅ `Fraud Detection Case Study.pdf` → `fraud_detection_presentation.pdf`

### Notebooks
- ✅ `01_Anomaly_Detection_Analysis.ipynb` - Already professional
- ✅ `02_Fraud_Detection_Models.ipynb` - Already professional
- ⚠️ `Entire_Work.ipynb` - Backup/archive (can be removed)
- ⚠️ `FraudDetection.ipynb` - Backup/archive (can be removed)

### Documentation
- ✅ All README files updated with new filenames
- ✅ All notebook references updated
- ✅ All documentation references updated

## Project Folder Name

**Current**: `FraudDetection`

**Options**:
1. **Keep as is** - PascalCase is acceptable for project folders
2. **Rename to**: `fraud-detection-analysis` (kebab-case, more descriptive)
3. **Rename to**: `fraud-detection-ml` (shorter, kebab-case)

**Recommendation**: Keep `FraudDetection` - it's clear, professional, and PascalCase is common for project folders.

## Files to Consider Archiving

- `Entire_Work.ipynb` - Appears to be a duplicate/backup
- `FraudDetection.ipynb` - Original combined notebook (now split)

These can be:
1. Moved to an `archive/` folder
2. Deleted if no longer needed
3. Kept as backups

## All References Updated

✅ Notebook file paths
✅ README.md
✅ SETUP.md
✅ data/README.md
✅ presentations/README.md
✅ PRESENTATION_GUIDE.md

## Naming Convention Applied

- ✅ Lowercase with underscores
- ✅ Descriptive and clear
- ✅ No spaces
- ✅ Consistent pattern
- ✅ Professional appearance
