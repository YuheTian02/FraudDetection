## Naming Standards Applied

### ✅ Conventions Used:
- **Lowercase with underscores** for data files and presentations
- **Descriptive names** that clearly indicate content
- **No spaces** (replaced with underscores)
- **Consistent patterns** across similar file types
- **Professional appearance** suitable for portfolio

### ✅ File Categories:

1. **Notebooks**: `01_Anomaly_Detection_Analysis.ipynb` (numbered, descriptive)
2. **Data Files**: `fraud_detection_dataset_part1.xlsx` (descriptive, consistent)
3. **Presentations**: `fraud_detection_presentation.pdf` (clear, no spaces)
4. **Documentation**: Standard `.md` files with clear names

## Project Folder Name

**Current**: `FraudDetection`

**Status**: ✅ **Keep as is** - PascalCase is professional and acceptable for project folders

**Alternatives** (if you prefer):
- `fraud-detection-analysis` (kebab-case, more descriptive)
- `fraud-detection-ml` (shorter, kebab-case)

**Recommendation**: Keep `FraudDetection` - it's clear, concise, and follows common conventions.

## Backup Files

The following files are backups/duplicates and can be archived or removed:
- `Entire_Work.ipynb` - Duplicate/backup
- `FraudDetection.ipynb` - Original combined notebook (now split)

**Recommendation**: Keep them as backups or move to an `archive/` folder if you want a cleaner structure.
