# Fraud Detection Project
## Project Overview
This project focuses on fraud detection by analyzing application data, performing time-series analysis, and developing machine learning models. 
The goal is to identify fraudulent activities while maximizing business outcomes through optimized decision thresholds.

## Key Components
1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
   - Derived new features from temporal data to aid in analysis.

2. **Time-Series Analysis**:
   - Extracted temporal patterns to understand trends in fraudulent behavior.
   - Detected anomalies using Isolation Forest models.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created and transformed features to improve model performance.
   - Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features.

4. **Model Development and Optimization**:
   - Trained and evaluated various machine learning models.
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning and threshold optimization to align with business objectives.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The final model achieved a balance between fraud detection accuracy and business profitability.
   - Insights from the analysis provide actionable recommendations for deploying fraud detection systems.

## How to Use This Project
1. Ensure all necessary libraries are installed, including `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.
2. Load the dataset into the appropriate file path as specified in the notebook.
3. Follow the notebook sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.
4. Adjust hyperparameters or thresholds as needed to explore alternative scenarios.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional features or data sources, such as user behavior and transaction logs.
- Experiment with ensemble learning or deep learning approaches for improved detection.
- Implement real-time fraud detection with model monitoring and feedback loops.
